# Gaussian Mixture Model
Barebones implementation of simple ML algorithm

Simple implementation of a Gaussian mixture model

Used two data sets from UCI ML database:

**Bank Note Authentication:**

Attributes: *"skewness"* and *"curtosis"*

Clusters: *5*

Iterations: *25*

**Wine Quality - White Wine**

Attributes: *"total sulfur dioxide"* and *"chlorides"*

Clusters: *2*

Iterations: *50*


Numpy, scipy and pandas libraries were used for efficient i/o and processing. If you do not have these dependencies installed then you need to install them using pip.
I used various online references because of my lack of expertise in the statistics behind GMM and Python graph plotting. The following are the main ones:

To run the program simply download the file and run main.py
